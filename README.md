# Project: Create an AI-Powered Chatbot Using AutoGen to retrieve Weather Information of a city
## AutoGen is an open-source programming framework for building AI agents(AI chatbots), therefore, first we will install pyautogen library and then import autogen from it. Since, our autogen chatbot has to fetch weather data from an external API like OpenWeatherMap, therefore, requests module will be needed to fetch the information from the external API
